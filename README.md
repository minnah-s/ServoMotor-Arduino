A Servo Motor is a small device that has an output shaft. This shaft can be
positioned to specific angular positions by sending the servo a coded signal. As long as
the coded signal exists on the input line, the servo will maintain the angular position of
the shaft. If the coded signal changes, the angular position of the shaft changes. In
practice, servos are used in radio-controlled airplanes to position control surfaces like the
elevators and rudders. They are also used in radio-controlled cars, puppets, and of
course, robots.
